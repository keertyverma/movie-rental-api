## Setup

Make sure to follow all the steps mentioned below to run the application

<b>Install MongoDB</b>
To run this project, you need to install the latest version of MongoDB Community Edition first.
https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/

Once you install MongoDB, make sure it's running.

<b>Note:</b> We need to setup replica set in MongoDB in order to work with <b>Transaction</b>.
Follow this to setup replica set in DB - https://blog.tericcabrel.com/mongodb-replica-set-docker-compose/

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
   `git clone <repository-url>`
2. Install Dependencies `npm install`
3. Create `.env` file and setup environment variables.
   ```
   NODE_ENV=development
   PORT=3000
   JWT_PRIVATE_KEY=<your-secret-key>
   ```
4. Set `mongodbURI` variable in `config\development.json` file

   ```json
   {
     "mongodbURI": "mongodb://localhost:27021,localhost:27022,localhost:27023/movierental?replicaSet=dbrs"
   }
   ```

5. Populate the Database `npm run seed`
6. Run the application `npm run dev`.

   This will launch the Node server on port 3000. If that port is busy, you can set a different port in `.env` file.

   Open up your browser and head over to: http://localhost:3000/movie-rental-dev/api/v1/genres

   You should see the list of genres. That confirms that you have set up everything successfully.

7. To run unit tests -> `npm run test:unit`
8. To run integration tests -> `npm run test:integration`
